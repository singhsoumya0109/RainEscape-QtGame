# RainEscape-QtGame
A fun and interactive game built using Qt, where players control a character to escape falling raindrops by moving left and right. The game ends if too many raindrops land on the character. The project demonstrates simple 2D graphics, keyboard controls, and game mechanics in a Qt environment.
